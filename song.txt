Oh, she's sweet but a psycho 
A little bit psycho 
At night she's screamin' 
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"

Damn, my AP goin' psycho, 
lil' mama bad like Michael 
Can't really trust nobody 
with all this jewelry on you 

At night she's screamin' 
"I'm-ma-ma-ma out my mind"
Can't really trust nobody 
with all this jewelry on you
